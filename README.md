# Smart_Traffic_Management_System
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a Smart Traffic Management System that helps to reduce traffic congestion , and improves the traffic flow. It uses live images from the cameras at traffic junctions for detecting void space in between the vehicles and allocating more green signal to the lane which has less void space.

### Step 3 :  Timing calculation and  Raspberry pi processing and forwading the signal to GPIO pins

### Step 4 : Turning ON GREEN LED based on received value and sent signal back to Raspberry Pi for next cycle.
